Overview of adding https support to this http node server

create an ssl cert to facilitate the ssl handshake
	use openssl
		https://www.openssl.org/source/

	placing these certs inside new directory called https

	HERE'S THE CERT command
	cd into https
	openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem

	then answer the questions as best as I can
	country
	state
	locality
	organization name
	org. unit name
	common name


	this makes the certs

	these files will be used to make the https server

Update config to deal with both http & https configs
	http on port 80
	https on pt 443

update index
	creating 2 different servers, have the same functions
	refactor the http server to have 'modes'

	before creating the https part, just update http part first

		the sharedServer fn doesnt deal with PORT:
			- need to change where we START the server

	after moving a bunch of server logic from the http.createServer method to a separate function,
	build the HTTPS server:
		listens on different port
		passes the logic to sharedServer fn

	change server names to httpServer

	create https server
	  https server has options related to ssl & https
	  key & certificate matter most!


RUNNING 
node index.js
	starts 2 server
node env=production
	starts 2 5000 & 5001 servers
