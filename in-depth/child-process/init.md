# Child Processes
- `child_process` module
  - [Docs](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html)
  - allows spawning subprocesses
  - primarily through `child_process.spawn()`
  - a parent/child relationship exists between the "current" process and the child
    - Child Processes can be in any language
- `child_process.spawn()`
  - spawns a new process using a given command
  - can take command-line args in an arr
- spawning methods of interest
  - exec && execSync
  - execFile && execFileSync
    - variations on the exec && execSync methods
    - attempts to execute the provided path to a binary executable directly
  - spawn 
    - spawn is the only process of all these options that DOES NOT BUFFER THE CHILD PROCESS OUT
    - spawn will continue streaming output regardless of child-process output max: the others have a configurable max output max
    - because spawn will not max-out, spawn is the best option for long-running child-processes
  - spawnSync
  - fork
    - spawsn new process of the current js file
    - sets up interprocess communication (IPC)
- Config Options
  - exec && execSync take an options obj as 2nd param
  - spawn && spawnSync take an options obj as 3rd param
