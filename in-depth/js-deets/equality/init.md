# Checking Equality
Coersive equality, it's a thing.

## Double vs. Triple
- The Difference?!
  - THINK LIKE JAVASCRIPT
  
## Double Equals and Abstract Equality Comparison
  - The equal spec https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/index.html#sec-strict-equality-comparison
  - BOTH check the types

## Triple Equals and Strict Equality
- if types are not equal, does NOTHING ELSE

## Gotcha
- When the types match, the double-equals and the triple equals do the exact same thing. The Double-Equals does what the triple-equals does.
- "If I know the types, do I want to allow coercive comparison or not?"
- We should try to have the types be obvious
