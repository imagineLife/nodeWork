- the debugger key && the `--inspect` flag - don't seem to do anything?!
- assure object.create with prototype object is shaped correctly
- know the core node modules that are stream-based
- build a readable stream that parses a hardcoded array of content && on data logs content to console
- know how to make a node process 'detect' wether it was piped to or it was called directly from terminal


assure practice on ...
- js inheritance 
  - Object.create
  - constructor functions
    - levearging fnName.prototype = prototypeValueHere
    - building && leverage an `inherit` function
    - trying using the utils method `inherits` to assign 1 obj to another's prototype
  - Class Syntax
    - extending a fn
    - passing/calling the root obj through an inherited obj
- detecting wether a file is called from cli or from a pipe
- running child-process
  - exec syntax vs spawn syntax
- Asserting errors
  - naming assertion 'groups'
