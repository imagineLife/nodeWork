Storing some data
setup a regime to write data to the filesystem & retrieve it back

We need a library to get all that  setup

setup a some directories
mkdir .data
	its 'hidden'
	the things inside .data is not logic, just files

mkdir lib
	contains a library for working with data

	make nested file 
	this is where we'll spend some time
	data.js
		will be used for storing & editing data
		will have 2 dependencies
			fs
			path - to normalize the path to different directories
